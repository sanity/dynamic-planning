# PriorityFlow

## A simple project management methodology

by [Ian Clarke](https://blog.locut.us/about)

## Goals

- Ensure that we’re working on the right things at any given time
  - This requires prioritizing what’s important and correctly balancing short, medium, and long-term priorities

- Provide predictability to the rest of the team about what will get done when
  - This will require both prioritization and estimation of tasks

## What is a task?

A task is a **completable** piece of work, examples include:

- Fixing a bug
- Implementing a feature
- Investigating and proposing a solution to a larger problem

Tasks can vary in size from half a day’s work to a large project requiring several weeks.

Something like “improve UI” isn’t a task because it isn’t clear what it means to complete it, it is more a category of work.

## Planned and Potential work

- Planned work
  - Planned work contains a comprehensive prioritized list of the tasks that we will do as a company
  - The tasks at the top are those that should be started next
  - Tasks are removed from the Planned work list when completed
- Potential work
  - Potential work contains tasks we may do
  - New tasks added to the top
  - Periodically triaged and either prioritized and moved to planned work list, or deleted
